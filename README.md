<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Landing Screen Shot][landing-screenshot]](https://ta2at-demo.netlify.app)

This web application is the DEMO version of the TA2AT project (https://tatuate.es).

Its goal is to reduce the uncertainty of people who want to get a tattoo.

This is achieved through a tattoo previewer, which allows users to see how a tattoo would look like on their body before getting it tattooed. This previewer consists of a customizable 3D avatar, in which you can capture both tattoos uploaded by local tattoo studios, as well as tattoos uploaded by users themselves. You can also place and modify the tattoo to your liking, and share it with your friends so they can give you their opinion.

[![Explore Page][explore-screenshot]](https://ta2at-demo.netlify.app)

There are up to 3 different roles in the application: user, tattoo studio and administrator. Each of them has its own functionalities and different views. (admin view not included)

Since it is a DEMO, the availability of the services and the persistence of the data is not guaranteed. That is to say, it is not guaranteed that the data stored in the application will be maintained over time.

For this version of the application there is no backend to manage the data, so the application has a temporary storage.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

For **users**, the Explore page offers the opportunity to peruse our extensive tattoo gallery, tailor your avatar's appearance, and experiment with different tattoo options for your virtual character. Moreover, you have the option to communicate with the tattoo studio that has uploaded a design you admire, enabling you to arrange an appointment at your convenience.

For **tattoo studios**, an interactive dashboard is available, providing a comprehensive overview of the engagement surrounding your uploaded tattoo designs. This platform also facilitates the seamless uploading of your tattoo creations, allowing you to preview them on a standard avatar. Additionally, it grants you access to notifications and messages from prospective clients, streamlining your communication and management process.
